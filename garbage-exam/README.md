<h2> How It Works?</h2>

<p> We classify garbage into 3 categories: Harmful, Organic, Inorganic.</p>
<ul type = "circle">
  <li><p>Harmful: medicine, cosmetic, battery, hardware, bulb, ...</a></p></li>
  <li><p>Organic: animal, plant, food, ...</p></li>
  <li><p>Inorganic: medal, glass, plastic, dust, ceramic, paper, fiber, ...</p></li>
</ul>

<p> Using pre-trained model of imageNet in ILSVRC 2012 to recognize the picture.</p>
<p> Using pre-trained model of Glove's word vetor - glove_model_6B.</p>
<p> To run the script, the additional model file of above 2 should be download to your computer.</p>
<p> Well, the script will download imageNet model automatically if it is not found in the corresponding directory.</p>
<p> To get the model of the pre-trained vector, you can visit <a href='https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api'> here </a> to have more options.</p>
